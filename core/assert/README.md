## What?

***Assert*** - *verb* - state a fact or belief confidently and forcefully.
([dictionary definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=assert))

When writing code we write *tests* to *automatically* check
our code is working as we *expect* it to.

Assert is the most *rudimentary* way of writing tests.
It provides no feedback when running your tests *unless* one fails.

The assert module has 11 methods but you will only (regularly) use
a few of them: **assert.equal**, **assert.deepEqual**
and **assert.throws**. Each are explained *with examples* below.


### assert.fail(actual, expected, message, operator)

The first method (alphabetically), but the least useful for practical.

Throws an exception that displays the values for actual and expected separated
by the provided operator.

Example:
```js
assert.fail(21, 42, 'Test Failed', '###')
```
Output:
```js
  throw new assert.AssertionError({
        ^
AssertionError: Faild
    at Object.<anonymous> (assert.js:2:8)
    at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
    at startup (node.js:119:16)
    at node.js:906:3
```
Usefulness: virtually *none*.
I haven't found a *practical* use for this.

### assert(value, message), assert.ok(value, [message])

Tests if value is "truthy", it is equivalent to
assert.equal(true, !!value, message);

The simplest assertion.

Example:
```js
var assert = require('assert');

function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var expected = add(1,2);
assert( expected === 3, 'one plus two is three');
```

This will not have any output.
If you want to see output, you need to make the test *fail*:

```js
var assert = require('assert');

function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var expected = add(1,2);
assert( expected === 4, 'one plus two is three');
```

Output:
```js
assert.js:92
  throw new assert.AssertionError({
        ^
AssertionError: one plus two is NOT four
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/n/code/node-js-by-example/core/assert/assert.js:8:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
```

`assert.ok(value, [message])` is essentially the same
as `assert(value, message);`

```js
var assert = require('assert');

function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var expected = add(1,2);
assert.ok( expected === 3, 'one plus two is three');
```
Again, no output because the test passes.
To see some feedback, make the test fail.

**Usefulness**: ***universal***.
**assert** can be used to test *any* code.


###Â assert.equal(actual, expected, [message])

Tests shallow, coercive equality with the (double) equal
comparison operator ( == ).

#### Why would you use assert.equal() instead of assert() ?

If you want to make your test clearer use assert.equal
otherwise there is no benefit to the additional verbosity.

Example:
```js
var assert = require('assert');

function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var expected = add(1,2);

// these three assertions are equivalent:
assert(expected == 3, 'one plus two is three');
assert.ok(expected == 3, 'one plus two is three');
assert.equal(expected, 3, 'one plus two is three');
```

### assert.notEqual(actual, expected, [message])

Tests shallow, coercive non-equality with the not equal
comparison operator ( != ).

Example:
```js
var assert = require('assert');

function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var expected = add(1,2);

// these three assertions are equivalent:
assert(expected != 4, 'one plus two is three');
assert.ok(expected != 4, 'one plus two is three');
assert.notEqual(expected, 4, 'one plus two is three (NOT Four!)');
```

#### Why would you use assert.notEqual(1, 2) instead of assert(1 != 2) ?

Again, verbosity/clarity in your tests.


### assert.deepEqual(actual, expected, [message])


## Try it!

You can't learn coding without *writing* code.
Open the **assert.js** file and try a few examples.
Remember you won't see any output unless your test *fails*.
Run it with the command:

```js
node assert.js
```
